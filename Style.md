# Style Guide


## Casing

For methods, function, and variable names we recommend use of the following

 - **camelCasing** for methods, functions and variable Names
 - **PascalCasing** for class names

## Tips and tricks

 - In javascript ===  uses strict equality which is a different comparison than == which will use loose equality.  Defaulting to === unless you intend to compare without type is a safe practice.
 - Var,  let, and const use different scoping.  When choosing which one to use, try to stick to let and const because var can be global and potentially have unintended collisions.
