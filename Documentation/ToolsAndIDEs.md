### Notes
**To Debug FoundryVTT with any Jetbrains IDE.** From the 'Run' menu, select 'Edit Configurations', click the '+' icon to add a debug configuration, choose 'Javascript Debug', set the URL to 'http://localhost:3000', choose which browser to use, click OK to save. Then, once you have started Foundry, start the debugger from the green 'bug' icon in the upper right corner of your IDE. The debugger will then start a browser that connects to foundry. All the usual debugger functionality then works from within the IDE.
